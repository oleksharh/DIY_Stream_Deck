# DIY Stream Deck

## Project Overview

The **DIY Stream Deck** project is a customizable and versatile macros keyboard designed for various applications and use cases. This DIY stream deck allows users to create and manage different profiles, enabling quick access to macros and commands tailored to specific needs. It features an interactive touchscreen and additional displays to provide real-time feedback and system monitoring.

## Components

### **1. Microcontroller**
- **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 N16R8 Devkit C1**
  - A powerful microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities for handling user inputs, controlling displays, and managing macros.

### **2. Touchscreen**
- **3.5-inch TFT LCD Touchscreen (Resistive)**
  - A 3.5-inch touchscreen for user interaction, macro display, and system status monitoring.

### **3. Custom PCB**
- **Gerber Files**
  - Custom PCB files are available in the repository for hardware assembly and component connections.

### **4. OLED Display**
- **0.96-inch SSD1315 Blue OLED Display**
  - A small OLED display to show additional information such as CPU and GPU temperatures or weather data.

### **5. Rotary Encoder**
- **EC11 or KY040 (360 degrees)**
  - A rotary encoder for precise input control, allowing for smooth scrolling and adjustments.

### **6. Housing**
- **3D Printed Housing Files**
  - 3D printed housing files will be included in the `/3d` directory to provide a customized enclosure for the keyboard.

### **7. Plexiglass**
- **For Buttons (Optional)**
  - Plexiglass can be used to give buttons an authentic look. Alternatively, the design can work without plexiglass buttons.

### **8. USB-C Cable**
- **For Power and Data Transfer**
  - A USB-C cable to power the device and manage data transfer between the keyboard and the computer.

### **9. Additional Tool**
- **Soldering Iron**
  - Oh, and donâ€™t forget to have an iron to be able to assemble everything together into the whole piece.

## Features

- **Customizable Macros:** Set up and manage macros with multiple profiles for different applications.
